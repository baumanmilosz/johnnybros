# JohnnyBros Landing Page
This project is resposive landing page in according to graphic project.
I used a few transition effects which in my opinion are in main style of page. For testing I used browsersync. Code was optimalized, also every transition. SASS code is logic and modular. I work in according to DRY principle. In some cases I kept a level head and readability was more important than repetitions.
